                            The stories in the Fairy Books have generally been such as old women in country places tell to their grandchildren. 
                            Nobody knows how old they are, or who told them first. The children of Ham, Shem and Japhet may have listened to them in the Ark, 
                            on wet days. Hector's little boy may have heard them in Troy Town, for it is certain that Homer knew them, and that some of 
                            them were written down in Egypt about the time of Moses. Now "The Arabian Nights," some of which, but not nearly all, are given 
                            in this volume, are only fairy tales of the East. The people of Asia, Arabia, and Persia told them in their own way, not for 
                            children, but for grown-up people.

                            People in France and England knew almost nothing about "The Arabian Nights" till the reigns of Queen Anne and George I., 
                            when they were translated into French by Monsieur Galland. Grown-up people were then very fond of fairy tales, and they 
                            thought these Arab stories the best that they had ever read.

                            They were delighted with Ghouls (who lived among the tombs) and Geni, who seemed to be a kind of ogres, and with Princesses 
                            who work magic spells, and with Peris, who are Arab fairies. Sindbad had adventures which perhaps came out of the Odyssey of 
                            Homer; in fact, all the East had contributed its wonders, and sent them to Europe in one parcel. Young men once made a noise at 
                            Monsieur Galland's windows in the dead of night, and asked him to tell them one of his marvellous tales. Nobody talked of 
                            anything but dervishes and vizirs, rocs and peris. The stories were translated from French into all languages, and only Bishop 
                            Atterbury complained that the tales were not likely to be true, and had no moral.

                                    The Haft Paykar, or Seven Portraits, is the fourth of the five narrative poems of the Khamsa of Nizami, and tells 
                                    the story of the legendary fifth-century Sasanian king Bahram Gur. The tale is believed to contain the poet’s own 
                                    views on love and emphasizes the importance of self-knowledge. Raised at the court of an Arab king, Bahram Gur one 
                                    day found his way into a locked palace room, where he encountered seven portraits of seven princesses representing 
                                    the seven climes of antiquity. After becoming king, Bahram Gur took these “seven beauties” as brides and built each 
                                    a domed pavilion. He visited each of his brides on successive days of the week, dressed in robes that matched the 
                                    color associated with each pavilion. In this painting, Bahram Gur wears a blue robe and is seated in the Turquoise 
                                    Pavilion of Princess Piruza (Persian for “turquoise”).

                            In the times of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid there lived in Bagdad a poor porter named Hindbad, who on a very hot day 
                            was sent to carry a heavy load from one end of the city to the other. Before he had accomplished half the distance he 
                            was so tired that, finding himself in a quiet street where the pavement was sprinkled with rose water, and a cool breeze 
                            was blowing, he set his burden upon the ground, and sat down to rest in the shade of a grand house. Very soon he decided 
                            that he could not have chosen a pleasanter place; a delicious perfume of aloes wood and pastilles came from the open 
                            windows and mingled with the scent of the rose water which steamed up from the hot pavement. Within the palace he heard 
                            some music, as of many instruments cunningly played, and the melodious warble of nightingales and other birds, and by 
                            this, and the appetising smell of many dainty dishes of which he presently became aware, he judged that feasting and merry 
                            making were going on. He wondered who lived in this magnificent house which he had never seen before, the street in which 
                            it stood being one which he seldom had occasion to pass. To satisfy his curiosity he went up to some splendidly dressed 
                            servants who stood at the door, and asked one of them the name of the master of the mansion.

                            envious of one whose lot seemed to be as happy as his own was miserable. Casting his eyes up to the sky

                            suffer a thousand hardships and misfortunes, and have hard work to get even enough bad barley bread to 
                            keep myself and my family alive, while the lucky Sindbad spends money right and left and lives upon the 
                            fat of the land! What has he done that you should give him this pleasant life--what have I done to 
                            deserve so hard a fate?"

                            came out of the palace, and taking him by the arm said, "Come with me, the noble Sindbad, my master, wishes to speak to you."
                            Hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons, and feared that his unguarded words might have drawn upon him the 
                            displeasure of Sindbad, so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not leave the burden which had been 
                            entrusted to him in the street. However the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of, and urged him to obey 
                            the call so pressingly that at last the porter was obliged to yield.

                            He followed the servant into a vast room, where a great company was
                            seated round a table covered with all sorts of delicacies.  In the
                            place of honour sat a tall, grave man whose long white beard gave him a
                            venerable air.  Behind his chair stood a crowd of attendants eager to
                            minister to his wants.  This was the famous Sindbad himself.  The
                            porter, more than ever alarmed at the sight of so much magnificence,
                            tremblingly saluted the noble company.  Sindbad, making a sign to him
                            to approach, caused him to be seated at his right hand, and himself
                            heaped choice morsels upon his plate, and poured out for him a draught
                            of excellent wine, and presently, when the banquet drew to a close,
                            spoke to him familiarly, asking his name and occupation.

                            "I am glad to see you here," continued Sindbad.  "And I will answer for
                            the rest of the company that they are equally pleased, but I wish you
                            to tell me what it was that you said just now in the street." For
                            Sindbad, passing by the open window before the feast began, had heard
                            his complaint and therefore had sent for him.
                            At this question Hindbad was covered with confusion, and hanging down
                            his head, replied, "My lord, I confess that, overcome by weariness and
                            ill-humour, I uttered indiscreet words, which I pray you to pardon me."

                            Only you appear to be mistaken about me, and I wish to set you right.
                            You doubtless imagine that I have acquired all the wealth and luxury
                            that you see me enjoy without difficulty or danger, but this is far
                            indeed from being the case. I have only reached this happy state after
                            having for years suffered every possible kind of toil and danger.
